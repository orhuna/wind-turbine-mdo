# Wind-Turbine-MDO

By: Orhun Aydin, Lewis Li and Wonjin Yun

Implementation of Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) for wind turbine design.

A single turbine optimization to compute optimal blade design parameters and most feasible location to implement the project on.

Experimental parameters:

Legislation (derived from 3 counties of interest in CA, KS and MI)
  Noise ordinance
  Blade clearance and maximum height
  
Wind resource
